# Code with Friend: Pomodoro Timer + Habit Tracker + Project Manager

For the month-long [CWF: Fall 2020](https://codewithfriends.io/events/cwf-fall-2020) event, I'll work on my long-delayed **Pomodoro Timer + Habit Tracker + Project Manager** project. Don't laugh, yes, it will be a mix of three app types.

## Getting Started

This app will be developed with Flutter and Dart.
